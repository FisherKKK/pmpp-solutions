# Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and problems presented in the book "[Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach 4th Edition](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/programming-massively-parallel-processors/hwu/978-0-323-91231-0)" by Wen-mei W. Hwu, David B. Kirk, Izzat El Hajj.

## About the Book

"[Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/programming-massively-parallel-processors/hwu/978-0-323-91231-0)" is a comprehensive guide to parallel programming using CUDA. It provides a practical, hands-on approach to understanding and implementing parallel algorithms on massively parallel architectures.

## About This Repository

This repository aims to provide a set of solutions for learners who are working through this excellent book. The solutions are organized by chapter, corresponding to the structure of the book.

**Please note:** These are my personal solutions (checked with Gemini2.5 Pro), and there might be alternative or more efficient ways to solve some of the problems. The goal is to provide a helpful resource for understanding the concepts and verifying your own work.
